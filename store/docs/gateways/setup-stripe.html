      Stripe has a nice easy to use test system so you can test the system before going live. For a list of test cards, visit the following url:<br><br>
     <b>https://stripe.com/docs/testing</b><br><br>
     You will need to use test keys when using the test system. You should click 'View test data' in the left menu OR use your test account and then follow the instructions above. Make sure
     you have test keys and a test endpoint set up. The test data does NOT post to the live endpoint.
